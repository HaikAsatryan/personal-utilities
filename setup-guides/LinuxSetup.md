# Comprehensive Linux Setup Guide for Ubuntu 25.10

## Introduction

This guide provides a full setup process for Ubuntu 25.10 (GNOME 49), automating developer tools, environment configuration, and GNOME customizations.
It includes a one-time (safe to rerun) script (`ubuntu-setup.sh`) to install and configure everything with minimal manual steps.

During installation, connect to Wi-Fi and select **Minimal Installation** if you prefer a lean system.

After the first boot:

1. Complete system updates through **Software Update** application.
2. Reboot once before proceeding.
